==========

A web based tracking system for the public transport
---------
This is the repository of my bachelor thesis at the TU Graz.

At least I want to implement the following features: 

* Possibilty to view and manage public transport routes.
* Display realtime information on a map (e.g. google maps) and in form of a table.
* Authorized users in the bus (e.g. the busdriver or registered passengers) should be able to automatically send their gelocation.


Sometimes I will blog about this project in my personal [blog](http://chm0815.blogspot.com) (german)
